# BrainFudge
by Tedd Lee and Eduardo Lozano

BrainFudge is a visualizer for running Brainfuck (BF) code. Given valid BF code, our program can run the code while simulating how operations are carried out. The program is customizeable: the user may run their code at different speeds and enter their own inputs.
