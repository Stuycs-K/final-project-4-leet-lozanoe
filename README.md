# BrainFudge
by Tedd Lee and Eduardo Lozano

BrainFudge is a visualizer for running Brainfuck (BF) code. Given valid BF code, our program can run the code while simulating how operations are carried out. The program is customizeable: the user may run their code at different speeds and enter their own inputs.

## Directions
If you don't already have it, you will need [Processing](https://processing.org/download) to run BrainFudge.

You will also need p5.js mode. Open Processing and click on the dropdown that says "Java" on the top right corner of the window. Select "Manage Modes" and install p5.js from the contribution manager window that pops up.

To run BrainFudge:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Processing and go to File>Open... and locate `BrainFudge.js` within the `BrainFudge` folder (in any mode).
3. Press the Run button and BrainFudge should pop up in your default web browser.
