# Homework
For homework, you will write your own BF code to produce your name. Use our visualizer to develop and test your code. Use `cybersecurity` as your input and output your full name. 

You must take in at least one letter of the input with `,` and use at least one loop `[ ]`. You'll find it's probably more annoying to NOT use them.

If you have a very long name just do your first name.

Put your BF code in a .txt file and submit it on Google Classroom.
